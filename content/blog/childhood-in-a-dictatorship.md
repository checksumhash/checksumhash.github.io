I am ashamed of writing about my childhood while children are getting killed in Iran by security forces. In a tragic episode, they killed Keyan Pirfalak, a 10 years old boy while he was in the car with his family. Children in the school are protesting and they get arrested and shooted inside schools everyday. Though families try hard to keep the children far from politics, childhood is still political in Iran.

I remember when I was about 4 years old, once I asked my mom on a bus, “what is politics?”, a very simple question but my mother suddenly got anxious, “shhh, not now” she responded with enormous anxiety. At night, I repeated my questions at home and the response I got was: “Well, politics means activities against the government which is very dangerous and you should avoid saying these things specially in public, it could cause you or your parents to get arrested”.

Of course, it was a wrong answer even for a four years old child, but you can still understand the amount of my mother’s effort to keep me away from politics. And part of this answer was true, yes it was very dangerous to talk about politics in public, you should be aware of government spies, and you should learn it even before going to school. I can remember in the school, there were some people or even the teachers who were asking students if they had satellite TV (which was and is forbidden in Iran) at home, or sometimes they referred to some programs from satellite TV to see children's reactions. You can see it’s very dangerous to send children without any preparation to the school.

In the family gatherings the situation was different. I can remember from our visits every week to grandparents that a lot of adult discussions were related to political situations. I don’t know about other families but mine was somewhat political, my uncles and my grandfather were interested in politics heavily and they were talking about hot political topics every week. Most of the time they disagreed with each other, however, as a child we were observers of those discussions. I clearly remember the 1997 election vibe, my father family were against participating in the election, but in the night of election, when we were out with my mother family, they decided to vote, came back to home to get their identity cards, and then they went to a election point to vote, I was with my mother, and I was constantly asking my mother who they want to vote for, she was trying to silent me, after we get back to the car, she told me that they have voted for Khatami, and as he is opposed to the governance, we should hide the fact that we vote for him. That election was a turning point in Iran's history. Khatami won the election strongly and it sparked the vibe of “reform” the term that nowadays everyone hates in Iran but the vibe those days was different. You can sense that the whole society is becoming more and more political, there was some relaxation in the censorship, so some newspapers and books emerged with serious contents. You can see everyone reading newspapers everywhere. Politics was something in the air and I as a child had a lot of questions. Unanswered questions, cause adults still were trying to keep us away from politics.

In 2001, on September 11 I was old enough to understand the situation. People with Satellite TV heard the news earlier and I remember my grandfather phoned our home and talked to my father, he told my father the news and the possibility of the war. He suggested that my father buy a big pack of rice and keep it at home, there was a war possibility!
